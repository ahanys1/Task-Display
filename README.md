# Homework-Display

## Concept

This project will consist of multiple aspects and programs working together. On The raspberry pi, it will communicate with a website to pull the data of what the assignment is, when it is due, and what class it is for. The website will be password locked, and accessible from my devices so that I can add items to the display when they are assigned in class. The display needs to be able to communicate to the raspberry pi to properly display assignments, as well as scroll a list if there are more than just the visable assignments.
